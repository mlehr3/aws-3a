- When AWS Services emits data to [[CloudWatch]], the availability of the data varies based on the service. When using **EC2**, with `Basic Monitoring`, data is available in *5 minute intervals* and with `Detailed Monitoring` it is available in *1 minute intervals.* **For all other services**, there is only `Basic Monitoring` with the majority coming in at *1 minute intervals* but depending on the service could be at a *three or five minute interval*.
