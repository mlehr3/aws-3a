- to obtain [[observability]] you need to use metrics, logs, and traces
	- metrics are a number that is measured over a period of time
	- logs are text files where each line contains event data at a point in time
	- traces are the history of a request as it travels through multiple apps/services
	- alarms is the fourth pillar of observability in the context of AWS
