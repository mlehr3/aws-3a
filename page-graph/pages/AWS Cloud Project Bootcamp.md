	- Iron Triangle:
	  collapsed:: true
		- Pick Two:
			- Scope: Features, Functionality
			- Cost: Budget, Resources
			- Time: Schedule
	- Architecture:
		- Conceptual Design:
		  collapsed:: true
			- *Napkin Design*
			- Created by business stakeholders and architects
			- Organizes and defines concepts and rules
		- Logical Design:
		  collapsed:: true
			- *Blueprint*
			- Defines how the system should be implemented
			- Environment without actual names or sizes
			- Example: undeployed CFT
		- Physical Design:
		  collapsed:: true
			- *As-Builts*
			- Representation of the actual thing that was built
			- IP Addresses, ARNs, EC2 Instances
	- Develop a Common Dictionary: RRAC Document
		- For each new project, gather RRACs:
			- Requirements, Risks, Assumptions Constraints
			- Requirements: Something that must be achieved at the end
			  collapsed:: true
				- Verifiable
				- Monitorable
				- Traceable
				- **Feasible**
				-
				- Examples:
					- Meets ISO Standards
					- 99.9% uptime
					- User can do specific task
			- Things that massage and change what requirements can or can't be
			  collapsed:: true
				- Risks: Something that prevents the project from being successful
					- Examples:
						- SPoFs reduce uptime (Single Points of Failure)
						- User Commitment
						- Late Delivery
				- Assumptions: Something that are held to be true for planning and implementation phases
					- Examples:
						- Sufficient Network Bandwidth
						- Stakeholders will be available to make decisions
						- Budget is approved
				- Constraints: Policy or technical limitations for the project
					- Examples:
						- Time - 4wks
						- Budget - $0
						- Vendor Selection - AWS
			- Ask dumb questions!!
				- Questions
					- Why are we here?
					  collapsed:: true
						- If there are at least 5 people in the room, there will inherently be confusion
				- Everyone has them, be the one to do it

			- Document Everything
				- So that a layman can understand
		- Architectural Frameworks:
			- C4 Model #card
			  tags:: Long AWS Course
				- Used for Visualizing Software Architecture
				- Context
				- Containers
				- Components
				- Code
			- Federals
			- TOGAF
				- Certification for the highest level architects at fortune 500 companies
				- Maps closely to [[Well Architected Framework]]
					- Underused
